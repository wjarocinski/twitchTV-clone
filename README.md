# twitchtv-clone
Clone of popular streaming site twitch.tv written in react + redux. 


To fully use the application you have to install OBS on your computer. 

Documentation to RTMP server - go under "publishing live streams/From OBS" to see how to set up OBS.

To install application run "npm i" in every folder (api, client, rtmpserver).

To run application use "npm start" exactly the same way as in installing process, 
but now for each folder open separate console window as we need to have database, application and server runing simultaneously.
